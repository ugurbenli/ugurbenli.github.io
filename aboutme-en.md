I graduated from Marmara University Computer Programming Department in <b>2015</b>. Then, in <b>2016</b>, I started taking a Microsoft Software Specialization course. I still work as a .Net Developer in Istanbul, and I'm thinking of doing this job lovingly until the desire to learn that inside me is over but I don't think will endðŸ™‚. At the same time, I am studying Management Information Systems at Anadolu University.
